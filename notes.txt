check the tests works


in PR description mention that fast mcp and fast api servers should exist independently, with a feature to mount the mcp_app on same fastapi app
the PR provides a very simple changes to allow that

the MCP client for now is just wriiten in the sample / echo_mcp_service script, 
however I think we can decide if we would like to generate a mcp client as well for available tools

a mcp app is create , a combine lifespan is passed to fast api app,
as we are alreay adding class functions as endpoints we can use the same to be added as mcp tools mounted on same app , 
making the app to be loaded only once. The next PRs will include Agent Integrations
